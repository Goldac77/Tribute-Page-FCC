        <p>Aloy is first introduced as an infant who has been entrusted to Rost's care by the Nora Tribe,
           and mysteriously declared an outcast by the Nora tribe. Six years later, while exploring on her
           own, she falls into a forbidden bunker that was created by ancient humans. While trying to escape
           from the destroyed facility, she discovers an augmented reality device known as a Focus before
           being rescued by Rost. Despite his misgivings, Rost allows her to keep the Focus, which she
           soon develops an affinity for. The next morning, while learning to hunt with Rost, she uses the
           Focus to rescue Teb, an injured member of the Nora tribe who has recklessly fallen into the path
           of machines. Aloy expresses the desire to learn the identity of her mother, and Rost suggests
           training to compete in the Proving, a coming-of-age ritual that would not only allow her entry
           into the Nora, but give her the answers she seeks as a boon if she wins <br><br>

           Twelve years later, she attends the Proving, winning the competition
           and being declared a Nora. Before she can ask about her parents, the tribe is attacked by a
           group of cultists led by the fanatical Helis, who seeks to kill Aloy. Most of her fellow
           warriors are murdered, but Helis hesitates when stabbing Aloy and is attacked by Rost,
           who then sacrifices himself to protect her from a blast. When she comes to inside
           All-Mother Mountain, one of the tribe's elders explains that Aloy was actually found
           in front of another bunker inside the mountain, and their disagreement over whether she
           was a good or evil omen led to her exile. However, her Focus reveals that Helis was
           given orders along with a picture of an older woman who looks just like her. <br><br>

          Aloy is declared a Seeker and sets out to avenge the attack on the tribe. Eventually, she
          is contacted by a man named Sylens, who reveals that the older woman is Dr. Elisabet Sobeck.
          Her genetic profile allows her to access the headquarters of Faro Automated Solutions,
          where she sees that Elisabet was a skilled scientist who was called in to try to stop a
          swarm of self-replicating combat robots that went rogue due to the recklessness of the
          company's CEO, Ted Faro. She then sets out to discover what Project Zero Dawn, which Elisabet created, planned to do. <br><br>

          Eventually, Aloy discovers that Zero Dawn was a project that involved allowing humanity
          to go extinct and reviving them using artificial wombs after the threat of the robots
          was dealt with and the Earth was "re-seeded". However, a mysterious signal attacked
          Zero Dawn's AI, GAIA, forcing her to self-destruct and unshackling her component
          processes. With nothing to protect humanity from the rogue AI of HADES, initially
          created as an emergency "reset switch" for the planet, GAIA was forced to order
          ELEUTHIA, a sub-function tasked with maintaining the artificial wombs, to clone
          Elisabet using DNA stored for the defunct "Lightkeeper Protocol", predicting that
          her genes would cause her to become the world's savior once again. Aloy was brought
          outside the facility by a robot, leading the elders to believe she had mysteriously appeared there. <br><br>

          Reaching the entrance to GAIA Prime, Aloy witnesses a series of significant damages
          caused by GAIA's self-destruction and is skeptical that GAIA could ever be repaired.
          While exploring the Zero Dawn facility, Aloy also learns that Dr. Sobeck sacrificed
          herself to close a malfunctioning vent and save the project from the encroaching all-consuming robots. <br><br>

          Upon realizing this, Aloy sets out to find the Master Override that can shut down HADES.
          With the help of Sylens, she obtains the Override and confronts HADES, shutting it down in
          the nick of time. In an ending scene, she is seen finding the body of Dr. Sobeck and getting closure in the search for her origins.

        <p>Why Aloy, well she inspires me to keep pushing, to never give. That even if I have to travel the world to accomplish my goal,
        I have to keep going. Being treated as an anormally, because you're different, keep those thoughts away and focus on what's important to you</p>
